This is a test to learn `git fetch` and `git pull`.
Here how I want to do this practice:
1. I make the "test.txt" file in the GitHub repository.
2. I clone this repo to my local machine.
3. After cloning, I make a new change to this repository on GitHub.
4. The changes are not applied to my local machine repository yet. So, I try `git fetch` and `git pull` commands.
